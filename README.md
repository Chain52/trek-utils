# Trek Utilities

This repository contains shared utility code used across the Trek platform, with a primary focus on abstracting database access and reusable server-side logic.

While this project was part of an archived business venture, the utilities in this repository reflect modular, scalable patterns for managing MongoDB access and common backend concerns.

## Architecture Overview

- **MongoDB Integration** – Mongoose-based connection and model handling
- **Schema & Model Builders** – Factory functions for composing reusable schemas and models
- **Query Execution Layer** – Structured CRUD, pagination, and aggregation support
- **Query Helpers** – Query sanitization and transformation utilities
- **Serverless App Support** – Exportable app structure to support serverless frameworks

## Status and Reflection

This repository is no longer maintained. Development of the Trek suite ceased very early in the process when it became clear the original concept too closely mirrored a prior employer's unfinished product. The effort was halted out of an abundance of caution and respect for intellectual boundaries.

While inactive, this library serves as a valuable reference for future backend or service design.
